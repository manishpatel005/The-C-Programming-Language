# The-C-Programming-Language
This is a repository that contains solutions to the problems of one the most fundamental books of Computer Science- "The C Programming Language"
also known as "K&R" based on named of the authors -Kernighan and Ritchie. I do not hold any copyright over the book for they remain with the author and the publisher PHI. 
These solutions are correct to my knowledge(as little as it is). Any suggestions to improve the solutions are highly appreciated.
